The build is very simple, just run **make** in the root directory.

We put bash script in the directory runscripts and the usage is the same as part I. For example, if you want to run CSE on CSEbasictest benchmark, just run

	./CSE.sh $BENCHMARKS/CSEbasictest

It will produce two files, one called CSEnotopt.ll and the other is CSEopt.ll.

Benchmark suit is located in $BENCHMARKS directory.
