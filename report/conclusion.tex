\section{CONCLUSION}

There are many tricks when using LLVM and we managed to conquer many difficulties when dealing with problem with LLVM such as Instruction visiting. With our interface, we create several sub classes and they perform similarly from the perspective of our design.

One thing that is frustrating is after running mem2reg pass, it is hard to do some optimizations because mem2reg pass has done a lot for us like I mentioned above.

Anyway, LLVM IR is very useful and convenient. Qualcomm compiler team is also choosing LLVM as their developing tool. That's the charm of LLVM. \\
